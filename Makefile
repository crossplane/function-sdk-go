# We manage the build/ folder and its Makefiles as a submodule.

# all fail, and this target will be run. The next time, the default as defined

# NOTE(hasheddan): the build submodule currently overrides XDG_CACHE_HOME in
# order to force the Helm 3 to use the .work/helm directory. This causes Go on
# Linux machines to use that directory as the build cache as well. We should
# adjust this behavior in the build submodule because it is also causing Linux
# users to duplicate their build cache, but for now we just make it easier to
# identify its location in CI so that we cache between builds.
